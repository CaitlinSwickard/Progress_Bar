# Progress Bar

For this project I built a progress bar. This bar completes both circle color change as well as a line fill in as the steps are completed. Click the Next button to complete steps, click the Prev button to move back a step. This sort of progress bar can be used on other projects like steps to complete for a shopping cart for E-commerce or progress in filling out a form.
